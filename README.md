# uchi-beamer-template
A Beamer template with a UChicago-esque theme.

## Usage
Download the lone TeX file in this repository and put in whatever you want. 
You'll need to use XeLaTeX to compile it, as that's the only package that 
allows custom fonts like in fontspec.

### Overleaf
Open the project where you have this presentation. In the top-left corner, click
"Menu". This will open a sidebar with a bunch of options. Under the section labeled
"Settings", you'll see an option "Compiler". By default, this should be LaTeX or
PDFLaTeX, but you need to change that option to XeLaTeX.
